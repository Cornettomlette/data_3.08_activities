# 3.08 Activity 1

Keep working on the `bank` database.

- With `pd.read_sql_query`, you can also use the database url connection string instead of the engine. Try it.
- Also, `pd.read_sql_table` will accept a table name and will retrieve the whole table. The `pd.read_sql` is a convenient wrapper around both functions. Explore those functions on the table `district`.
